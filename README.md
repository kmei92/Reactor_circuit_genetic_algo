#Minutes Tuesday Meeting


•	Genetic Algorithm code: Done

•	Circuit simulation code: Ongoing

•	Validity checking function: Ongoing


Tasks to be done and timeline
•	Circuit simulation code: Tuesday 
•	Validity checking function: Tuesday
•	Testing functions: Tuesday
•	Measuring rate of convergence of original code? Tuesday
•	How is the rate of convergence affected by the number of child vectors used? Wednesday
•	How is the rate of convergence affected by mutation rate? Wednesday
•	What values would you recommend based on the observed trends in the optimum configuration? Wednesday
•	Investigate how probability of crossing selected parents (0.8 – 1) affects rate of convergence. Wednesday
•	Investigate how rate at which mutations are introduced (<1% probability) affect rate of convergence. Wednesday
•	Parallelisation using OpenMP: Thursday
•	Code documentation and auto-documentation: Thursday
